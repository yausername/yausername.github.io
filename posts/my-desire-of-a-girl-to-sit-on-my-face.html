<p>I have this weird desire that a girl, who I like, would lovingly and
willing sit on my face. I care about this so deeply. I wonder why? It is
not the act of it that makes me want it. It is the circumstances that
make the act possible which I so deeply want. I could trick a girl into
liking me and then maybe even make the circumstances possible in some
way, but that would be fraud.</p>
<p>What I really desire is that the circumstances naturally exist. But I
cannot imagine how or why would such circumstances exist. And they will
never exist until I myself believe that they can exist. How am I even
going to propose a girl for the said act if I myself don’t believe in
it.</p>
<p>I guess it is that belief I desire more than anything else.</p>
<p>Let’s see.</p>
